# Real-Time Sentiment Analysis for Customer Feedback

## Overview
This project implements a real-time sentiment analysis system using **neural networks** and **Streamlit**. The system classifies customer feedback into **Positive, Negative, or Neutral**. I trained the model on the **IMDb Movie Reviews dataset** and deployed it as an interactive web app.

---

## Objective
- Classify text feedback in real-time into three sentiments: Positive, Negative, or Neutral.
- Provide a web-based interface using Streamlit for user interaction.
- Demonstrate end-to-end deployment of a deep learning NLP model.

---

## Dataset
**IMDb Movie Reviews Dataset**  
- Contains labeled movie reviews for training the sentiment analysis model.
- Used for preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

---

## Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Tokenization, padding, and embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, or BERT embeddings).  
2. **Model Development**
   - Neural Network architectures: LSTM / RNN / GRU.  
   - Trained to classify text into Positive, Negative, or Neutral categories.  
3. **Streamlit Application**
   - Input text box for user feedback.  
   - Predict button to generate sentiment.  
   - Display predicted sentiment in real-time.  
4. **Deployment**
   - Fully functional web app deployed using Streamlit.  
   - Accessible for real-time sentiment predictions.

## Results
- Trained a neural network model for sentiment classification.  
- Built a **real-time web app** for user feedback analysis.  
- Achieved high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
- Demonstrated practical application of NLP and deep learning.
